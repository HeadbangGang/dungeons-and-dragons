# Dungeons and Dragons
[Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.taydenflitcroft.com) is a web app created to be used during my friends and my weekly Dungeons and Dragons session. It includes a random number generator that accentuates when a 1 or a 20 (the worst and best roll possible on a 20 sided die), as well as a real time data sheet to track each players initiative value (or turn order). This application utilized Google's Firestore database to persist all data. The apps main functionality is hidden behind user authentication, below are test account credentials with limited functionality that is available for use.
